REG EX

is this pattern anywhere in that text?

. match any char (only one character)  - all only match one character
\ - escape character - turns it into one thing

\w - a-z, 0-9, _   nothing else

\d - 0-9 - any digit

\D - anything that's not 0-9

\n - new line

\s - any whitespace character

carat - very beginning of a new line

$ - end of a line

puttin in multiple characters, only matching one

[] - a set of different characters that you want to match - "character class"
[aeiou] - would match any of those characters
[0-9] - 
[a-z] - not match mult letters only match one
[a-z, ']

capture parts of a regular expression
(piece of reg ex here) - match the entire but just return the part in parens
i.e., run it, match all the email addresses and retun only the domain names.


* 0 or more (to infinity) of those characters  

+ 1 or more  
?  0 or 1

example: ae*b ---> match ab  aeb  aeeb
ae+b ---> match NOT ab  aeb  aeeb
ae?b ----> ab aeb NOT aeeb

| or   a | b - match an a or a b

\\ - gives you an actual backslash



non literal version new obj(), new Array()
literal version [], {}

literal vers of reg ex
/.+ab\dx1/

can put flags on your reg ex to change it's behavior
put them flags after the final slash

/.+ab\dx1/ig   <---- i - case insensitive, g - global..  not just match the first occurrence, match every occurrence.


cmd opt f - to open sublime console.. click lower *
